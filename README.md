# Javascript timed Quiz
## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to create a timed five question quiz on Javascript knowledge. </br>
Users will have a total of 100 seconds to complete the quiz. Each time they miss a question the user will lose 10 seconds and 10 points will be deducted from their final score. </br>
Upon clicking "Start Quiz" the users first question will appear to choose from 4 multiple choice options. </br>
Whether the user selects an incorrect or correct answer it will display accordingly at the bottom of the quiz window.</br>
Once completing the quiz or the timer hits zero the quiz will stop running and the highscore will then be displayed. </br>
When the highscore displays the user can enter their initials and it will take them to the highscreen window to show how their peers did with the quiz. </br>
They may also clear the highscores and go back to try another attempt at the quiz if they like.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JS

## Moving Forward
- I would like to add more functionality to the quiz to play sounds when the user gets a question right or wrong. Which is currently in the code just commented out for now.

## Lessons Learned
I learned a lot throughout this project
- I utilized all of my resources doing this from scratch. To include my friends that are in the field now, my tutor / TA and a whole lot of google.
- I learned a lot of advanced Javascript to make this work the way not only I wanted it to work but also how the cohort wanted this to function.
